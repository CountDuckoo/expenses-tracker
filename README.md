## Description
This project is a full-stack application built with JavaScript, Handlebars.js, and MySQL that you can use in your daily life. Since almost everyone uses money daily and could probably be a little better at spending less/saving more, we decided an expenses tracker would be useful to most. We are targeting people that spend money and want more knowledge of what kind of things they buy the most, or how much they have leftover to spend/save. How we do this is by having the customer input there transactions and show a categorized pie chart custom to your spending.

You will then need to look at your banking info and input all the transactions for the week, whether it is money coming in or money going out. Once you have input all transactions for the week and their category, then you will see a pie chart with those categories and what percent of your money you spent on each category. There is also a place for you to look at all transactions you have put in, or edit/delete transactions if needed.
